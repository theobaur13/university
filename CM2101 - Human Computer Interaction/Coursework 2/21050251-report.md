## Write the hypothesis with the blanks filled.

It is quicker to post an image and people rank Twitter higher than Reddit using the SUS because of its faster page loading speed and user-friendly interface 


## Compute the SUS score percentile rank for your 'Candidate System' and 'Comparison System' and include the equation with terms explained.

SUS Percentile Rank Score = 16.67 0

SUS Percentile Rank Equation = Twitter PR = (i1/n)*100
Reddit PR = (i2/n)*100

Explanation: Twitter PID 1-10, Reddit PID 11-20
Twitter SUS median = 53.5
Reddit SUS median = 15
No. of data points: n = 6
No. of SUS scores below Twitter median: i1=1
No. of SUS scores below Reddit median: i2=0

## Give a clear (e.g., step-by-step) description of your experiment procedure and comment on your design (Max 400 words).

1. Participants gathered from university and randomly halved into Twitter and Reddit groups through mailing lists and university social media, ensuring similar age distribution which helps control for general internet skills and physical factors like poor motor skills and eyesight.

2. Each participant will get a computer, with the same specifications and screen size as these affect speed and interface visibility.
The specification should represent a *standard* computer to capture any loading speed variations, without encountering system-specific issues only occurring on outdated machines.

3. Participants will watch a prerecorded video on their system's basic features presented by the same instructor. Videos include instructions to post an image located at their desktop with a caption and other basic features, aiming to bring participants to a baseline familiarity with the systems, considering unequal prior experience not controlled for in step 1.

4. Participants get a document with three photos, each with a corresponding caption. Photos should be in a desktop folder to prevent participants from being unable to find the files, potentially altering TTC. Photos and captions will be consistent for each user, with single-word captions, to avoid TTC variations due to typing speed and file upload times. 

5. Participants get an account and start on the homepage. Then, start recording the screen. They must start uploading their images individually with the assigned caption. TTC and ERR will be measured later using the recording. 

6. Upon completion, users will fill out an online SUS questionnaire immediately to prevent forgetting their system's usability. Online administration preferred for honest feedback as it's less pressure than in-person.

Between-groups design was chosen mainly to control for experience differences gained from using the systems. A between-groups design allows users to gain experience with the system over time, resulting in expected improvements in TTC across three attempts as users become more familiar with the system. All participants perform their task three times, making the experience gained by usage comparable. 

A within-groups approach requires participants to perform the task three times with both systems, either in random order where tasks performed on systems consecutively may mean users gain more experience with those systems, or in an order where 50% of volunteers have Reddit first and 50% have Twitter, introducing learning or carryover effects, both skewing TTC. 

Within-groups lets users act as their own control, giving any changes between systems more statistical power. However, learning and carryover effects are critical to control for in this experiment.
