function ss = cf_equalise(s,b)
% CF_EQUALISE Apply a multi-band equalization filter to an audio signal.
%
%   SS = CF_EQUALISE(S, B) applies a multi-band equalization filter to the
%   audio signal S, using the band gain values specified in the vector B.
%   The function returns the equalized audio signal as SS.
%
%   Inputs:
%   - S: a 2-element cell array containing the sound signal data and the
%   sampling frequency.
%   - B: a 11-element vector containing the gain values for each of the 11
%   frequency bands used in the equalisation filter. The frequency bands
%   center around the frequencies: 16 31.5 63 125 250 500 1000 2000 4000 
%   8000 16000
%
%   Outputs:
%   - SS: a 2-element cell array containing the equalised sound signal data
%   and the sampling frequency. The data in SS is a column vector.
%
%   Example usage:
%   1. To equalise the sound signal contained in a cell array variable named
%   "s" with gain values specified in a vector variable named "b", type:
%   ss = cf_equalise(s, b)
%
%   Implementation:
%   The CF_EQUALISE function splits the sounds data from S{1} into 11 bands
%   that center around the frequencies: 16 31.5 63 125 250 500 1000 2000 
%   4000 8000 16000. A low shelf filter is applied to the first band, peak
%   filters are applied to bands 2-10 and a high shelf filter is applied to
%   band 11. These filters are given in __________. The gain values from B
%   are then applied to each band, with the index of each gain value
%   corresponding to a single band. This process is repeated for each audio
%   track.
