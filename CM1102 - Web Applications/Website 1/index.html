        <h3>Early life</h3>
    
        Alan Turing attended Sherborn school in Dorset from 1930, however he often outshone his peers academically. For example at 13
        Turing was able to study scientific theories such as general relativity. This lead him to gravitate towards Christopher Morcom,
        another gifted student and they became close friends for years. However Morcom died of tuberculosis in 1930, affecting Turing
        negatively.
        
        In 1935 Turing achieved an academic scholarship from the University of Cambridge to study mathematics where he thrived, acheiving 
        a distinction mark.
        
        
        <h3>Career</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In 1936 Turing published his first design for the Universal Turing Machine. This machine could in theory perform any set of instructions
            fed to it and is the basis for all computers today. This is now recognized as the foundation of computer science.
        </li>
        <li>
            In 1939 Turing was joined a government code-breaking department with other mathematicians based in Bletchly Park, who helped develop
            a machine to quickly decipher Enigma messages.
        </li>
        <li>
            In 1941, Turing's team "Hut 8" mastered the german submarine communications system winning the battle of the Atlantic.
        </li>
        <li>
            In 1946 Turing helped to create a design for the very first digital computer called the Automatic Computing Engine, this machine contained memory
            and was able to run applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            In 1950 Turing moved to the University of Manchester to focus on the philosiphy of computing and produced a paper containing ideas such as the 
            "imitation game" and the "Turing Test", which are still being used today in research of AI.
        </li>
        <li>
            
            In 1952 he was prosecuted for gross indecency due to having an affair with a man, homosexuality was still illegal at the time. Turing was given the
            choice of going to prison or undergoing a chemical castration, eventually choosing the latter. He also got his clearance revoked ending his career
            in government work.
        </li>
        <li>    
            Finally, in 1954 Turing died by cyanide poisoning, which was ruled a suicide by the coroner.
