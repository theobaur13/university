    <h1>Alan Turing</h1>
    <h2>How Alan Turing's work relevant today?</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>Turing's work on the Universal Turing Machine has been the basis for Von-Neumann Architecture, which, in turn, is currently the basis for all modern
        computers today. Von-Neumann Architecture allows computers to be reprogrammed, as well as storing data. Turing machines are also relevant today for
        the purpose of testing the strength of programming languages. </br></br>
        Since a Turing Machine is theoretically able to compute any task, a programming language
        can be compared to a Turing Machine. If the programming language can perform any task it is said to be "Turing Complete" therefore has a high strength,
        which is desirable for a programming language. Most modern programming languages are said to be Turing Complete, although the limitation of finite memory
        is ignored
        <br>
        <br>
        Alan Turing's Automatic Computing Engine still has relevance today as it was the first full design for a computer with stored memory, reprogrammability
        and an electronic system. However, the machine did not get built as planned as his colleagues at the NPL thought it would be far too difficult to build,
        therefore they resorted to a smaller, weaker machine called the Pilot Model ACE. Had his design gone ahead the Automatic Computing Engine would have a
        far higher speed and memory capacity.
