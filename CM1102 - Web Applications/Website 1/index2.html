    <h2>What contributions has Alan Turing made?</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <h3>Universal Turing Machine</h3>
    
    <p>
        The universal turing machine is a concept that is the foundation for how computers operate today, all computers programs can be simulated on a turing
        machine, no matter how complex. It consists of an infinitely long tape split into squares, each square can have a 1 or 0 on it. There are
        defined states containing instructions telling the machine if it should change the current number or not and what state to go into next. The machine must
        be in a state at all times therefore when a program is finished it goes into a halting state. 
        </br>
        </br>
        This machine is used to test the strength of programs today, if a program acts the exact same way as it would if it were performed on a Turing Machine
        then it is said to be "Turing complete", meaning it is of the highest strength. This is often used to test programming languages, as ideally a language
        should be able to be used to perform any task. 

    </p>
    
    <h3>Imitation Game</h3>
    <p>
        Turing proposed that in the future we will not be able to tell the difference between a human and a machine output, given the machine has 
        sufficient hardware and memory. He designed an "imitation game" in which a human interrogator must distinguish a machine from a human and 
        predicted that half a century from when the paper was written, (1950) human interrogators will not be able to differentiate with more than
        a 70% chance in the game.
        </br>
        </br>
        Turing also predicts the existence of machine learning based on a "conditioned reflex" to a certain stimulus, and therefore if the few processes
        in a childs brain can be replicated then a full human mind could also be simulated on a computer by exposing the "childs mind" to various forms
        of education and teaching methods. Therefore, in theory machines will be able to compete with humans in almost every field, given the improvement
        of hardware and enough time.
